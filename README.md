# 2D-Kuramoto-Sivashinsky

Exectutable files and modules for the numerical solution of the two-dimensional Kuramoto-Sivashinsky equation.

There are two main files: 
- 2d_ks_single.exe, and 
- 2d_ks_single_L.exe.
These correspond to solving the equation on [0, 2*pi] x [0, 2*pi] or [0, 2*Lx] x [0, 2*Ly] domains, respectively.

The values of the various parameters are defined as inputs and can be found in files data_2d and data_extra. Users can modify these to run the code for different parameter values.
